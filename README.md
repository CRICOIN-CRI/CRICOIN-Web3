CRICOIN - Web3
Project Description

CRICOIN is an innovative project that will use an ERC-20 token to create a community dedicated to cannabis research and medicinal uses, as well as advocating for its regulation and legalization. 
This repository is intended for the development of a web3 page using Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which will be accessible at www.cricoin.eth. 
ENS is the most widely adopted blockchain naming standard in the industry, providing an enhanced and simplified user experience.
